# Intro to HTML, CSS, Typescript (and JS)
This is a sample for the lesson [[ENG1.0] Intro to web apps.md](https://github.com/microsoft/TNT_Curriculum/blob/master/Week%201/%5BENG1.0%5D%20Intro%20to%20web%20apps.md)

## How to start the game
1. Install typescript globally using `npm install -g typescript`
2. Inside this directory (i.e. TNT_Samples\Week_1\web-app-intro) run `tsc -p .` This will compile the `app.ts` file and generate `app.js`
3. Now open the file `index.html` in browser and start playing!!

**Note:**
- An alternative to step **`3.`** above is to use `Go Live` feature of VS Code. 
- Install Liver Server extension.
- Simply, open the `index.html` file in VS Code and click on `Go Live` button in the bottom right corner.
- This will start a local server and open the file for you in the browser.
