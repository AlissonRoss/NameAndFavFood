# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Before you make a contribution, check out the [contribution guide in CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Samples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for best practices.

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
