## Goal of the project

This project showcases how to use React with Redux to create a store to update a counter.

This differs from teh 'redux-simple-counter' in two major ways:

1. The redux-adjacent stuff is kept to a minimum, is all in a single file ("ReduxStuff.tsx"), and provides the more realistic scenario of creating actions that need parameters / information to do their job

2. There are two components which use the Redux state, instead of just one
